On Generational Age Group Tendencies: 
Millennials (1981 - 1996) made up the largest percentage of NYC CitiBike riders for March 2020, followed by Gen X (1965 - 1980). Given that the oldest age a Gen Zer could be right now is 24, this makes sense that they would have a low percentage considering you have to be 16 in order to actually use the CitiBikes. Also, with the machines taking card payments that could be problematic if the younger group of eligible Gen Zers don't have bank accounts of their own yet or might not carry credit cards. There are no current census breakdowns by generation for the population of NYC, but I also speculate that a large percentage of the population falls into the Millennial and Gen X categories. Though Millennials make up the largest user percentage, Gen X typically shows a longer ride time. It's possible that Gen X either rides a bit slower from place to place or they are taking more leisurely bike rides.

On Busy Riding Times:
Between 5:00 PM (17:00) - 7:00 PM (19:00) was the most popular time to ride CitiBikes in NYC in March of 2020. This leads me to believe that people who live in NYC are taking bikes home from work since 5:00 is a common end to the workday or school day. Similarly, 8:00 AM also shows a strong count of trips, indicating people are riding on their way to work or school. A second theory is that people of NYC like to take the bikes for exercise after their workday is done. I would expect more leisurely bike rides to be done in the daytime since the sun sets in March around 4:00-5:00 PM. It is interesting that the largest percentage of bike rides in the city would be when it is getting dark for this particular month. I would assume summer months would see different popular hours. 
  

On CitiBike Gender Makeup:
The data on the March 2020 Quick facts page uncovered that men made up the majority of CitiBike riders at an overwhelming 68%; nearly 3/4 of all NYC CitiBike Riders for March 2020 were male. The city of New York has a close to 50/50 split between the population of Men and Women according to the United States Census Bureau. Unidentified or other was not accounted for in that particular dataset, so that could be a possible limitation of this theory, but it doesn't seem like this drastic difference would be because of a lack of women in the city. It is possible that most women rely on other methods of transportation around NYC and might not have to bike to work. More women might have had work from home opportunities, or might have tried to stay home as to not get sick. An analysis representative of a longer period of time would likely help get some clarity as to why this was happening - i.e., if CitiBike commonly sees higher percentages of male users, if women are more active on CitiBike in warmer weather, etc. The percentage is quite staggering though.

On March 2020 vs. March 2021 Start Stations:
Though many of us remember March 2020 as the month the world shut down, there actually isn't much variance between March 2020 and March 2021 in CitiBike riders. In fact, March 2020 had more riders than 2021.Considering that many people were entering mandated quarantine beginning in March 2020, this finding is surprising. The top starting locations in March 2020 consisted of areas highly saturated with business offices, a Manhattan college, Union Square, Central Park, Madison Square Garden, and a Ferry Port. However, in 2021 many of the top starting locations were near Churches, parks, and areas highly saturated with restaurants and dining. In the March 2020 quick facts, you can see that the busiest days of the month were before March 11, indicating people of New York might have been going to work/college still and attending events as usual before entering quarantine. In 2021, it seems like more people were riding bikes leisurely to enjoy parks and get food - some of the only things available to do due to restrictions.
On March 2020 End Stations:
In comparison to 2020 start station locations, the markers on this map are less dense. It seems that possibly some of the CitiBike locations were not available/open in March. It also seems that the hot ending spots - or where people were headed - were near churches and parks. There are less locations, making the ones available have higher numbers. Compared to the maximum values from both the 2020 and 2021 Start Station maps, this has the highest amount of ending trips at one location at 7,669 compared to 2020's 6,677 and 2021's 5,085.
